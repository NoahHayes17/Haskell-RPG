# Terminal-Based Role-Playing Game

The Player navigates a connected world and interacts with characters. There is also a set of functions which allow any game to be solved, meaning a complete walkthrough of choices to reach the end of the game can be generated.

This exists as a framework, allowing for different worlds to be implemented and solved.

## How to play
1. Install ghci
2. Enter "ghci" in the terminal
3. Enter ":l HaskellRPG.hs"
4. The function "game" will allow you to play the game. The game can be played by selecting locations to travel to, a dialogue with one person, and selecting a dialogue between multiple people from the user interface. 
   The function "solve" will solve the game.
